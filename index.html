        <p>If you're a web developer, you certainly work with HTML (semantics?) and care about the position of your sites in Google search results (SEO).
            Leaving the pages of a site well ranked in search engines is a job that involves many factors and one of them is the quality of the code.</p>

        <p>The HTML language is one of the codes used and is the basis of every web page. It is used to define the elements and how they will be organized in the Document Object Model (DOM). Understand the DOM as the structure of the page and definition of the HTML elements that the browser will read and render on the screen.
            It's a good practice for every developer to generate optimized, compact, and semantic code. The DOM must have no more than 1,500 nodes; nor depth greater than 32 knots; nor a parent node with more than 60 child nodes. In addition, HTML tags must be used for the purpose they were created.</p>

            Whats's semantic tags
        </h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML is to use each tag according to its purpose. For example, the p tag serves to define a paragraph of long text, while the &lt;h1&gt; serves to define the main visible title of the page.
            <pre class="codigo" style="background-color: black; color:aliceblue;"> <code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
                
    <span>&lt;html lang="pt-br"&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;title&gt;Título da página&lt;/title&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
             <span>&lt;div&gt;</span>
                 <span>&lt;div&gt;</span>
                     <span>&lt;p&gt;Título visível&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                     <span>&lt;span&gt;Meu parágrafo&lt;/span&gt;</span>
                <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
               <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
               </code></pre>
            The following HTML code relies on a basic HTML structure following web standards. It has a defined title and paragraph, all with semantic HTML:</p>

        <h2>
            Aplication the semantic tags
        </h2>
        <p>When you use semantic HTML, the browser interprets the tags the way they should be, because each one has a meaning. This helps tools like screen readers and accessibility features for people with special needs.</p>
        <p>For the ranking of pages in Google and other search engines, semantic HTML helps crawling robots extract the content and make the correct association with the types of elements.</p>
        <p>Still talking about the robots, they like to "understand" the content of the page and extract the content quickly, so a small DOM is also very important. If it has a large DOM, the robot may not extract all the content, hurting the site's SEO and Google PageSpeed score.</p>
        <p>A large DOM also increases memory usage and generates longer style calculations, slowing down loading. Slow sites lose points on Google and other search engines.</p>
        <p>In addition to semantic HTML, try to also use structured data in your pages. With them it is possible to give even more meanings to the elements, filling in gaps that exist in the HTML and making the work of tracking robots even easier.</p>
